# Co-Op-Snake-2D

Description: This is solution that I have built for the assignment provided as a part of Outscal's curriculum. This is a 2D version of the Snake game that was built on Unity. It has got two modes to play, a signle player version and  the multiplayer version. 

Sample Video of the game interface(It was made on Loom, so at times it may not be accessible if I have had to delete the links in order to submit other videos for the completion of the curriculum):

3. In the multiplayer version, one of the snakes movement can be controlled using the arrow keys and the other snake's movement can be controlled using the keys W A S D.
4. Screen wrapping has been implemented - The snake when it hits the boundary will enter back into the game scene from the opposite end.
